# Delogy Design Ideas 


- telegraph lines 
- fog of war

- earthquake events 
- siren events 
- robot companion 
    - order him to mine a certain area 
- roguelike permadeath elements
    - player headstone 
- dungeons contained with better parts  
- engineering progression tree 
- prestige system 
- relationship system with villages 
- weight system (give items weight which lowers speed) 
- map system 
- orecarts linking together
- explosives 
- batteries 
    - chargers 
    - electric motor generator dc charging 
- mine ventilation blower 
    - intake shaft (brings air from the surface )
    - exhaust shaft (expels contaminated air to the surface )
- faults 
    - detail where ore deposits are 
- tipping rail switch will empties orecart storage into storage box 
    - hoppers into storage box 
- pressure rails, levers, circuit 
- salt 
    - evaporating water for salt 
    - pump water out of undergroudn springs, evaporwate with heated sluices 
    - use salt to keep preserve meat 
- hunting 
    - furs

    - ice 
    - stalagmite, limestone
    - volcano, lava
    - talus  
    - jungle 

- horde event combat (like terraria)

## World Idea
- there is a world underground but people underground don't know anything about the above 
- there are stations where work turns into rewards (food, items) (perhaps this powers the above ground?)

- there are patrol (siren creatures) where shelter is needed (they one shot any entity in sight)
- will ignore crops if certain qualifications are met 
- There can be multiple maps (multiple tilemanagers) 
    -  going to another map requires player traveling to edge of world 

## NPC AI 

- gene preferences 
- needs
- reaction to player 
- animations

- different biomes should lead to different NPC stats over time through natural selection

## Main Game loop idea 

1) Player gather resources 
2) Trade with NPCs 
3) Get reputation with NPCs 
4) Rule NPCs with this reputation 
5) Order NPCs for more resources 
6) Take over communities 
7) Become rich  and build
